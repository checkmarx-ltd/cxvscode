# CxCode for Visual Studio Code

CxCode is an IDE extension that enables scanning/retrieving results on/from Checkmarx CxSAST.

This is a pre-release version of the VS Code plugin for CxSAST.  We are not ready to publicly announce it yet; this is a preliminary version intended for our design partners.

This software is not (yet) supported by Checkmarx.  Download and install at your own risk.
